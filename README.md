# File Encryption and Decryption using AES
👤 Author: Sulaiman  
🏢 Organization: Elevate Laps — Cyber Security Internship

## 🔐 Overview
A Python program that encrypts and decrypts files using the AES algorithm (EAX mode) to ensure data confidentiality.

## ⚙️ How to Run (locally)
1. Install required library:
# pip install pycryptodome
2. Place the file you want to encrypt in the same folder.
3. Run:
# python file_encryption.py
4. Choose:
- `1` to encrypt → enter filename (e.g., `document.pdf`)
- `2` to decrypt → enter `.enc` filename (e.g., `document.pdf.enc`)

## 🧠 Notes
- The script uses a static 16-byte key (`ThisIsASecretKey`) for demo purposes. In production use secure key management.
- Encrypted files are saved with `.enc` extension.
